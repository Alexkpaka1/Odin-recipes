		<h2>These are the Steps you can use to make your homemade Salad</h2>
		<ol>
			<li>The better the bread, the better the crouton! Use artisan bread, French bread or sourdough bread from the store, or leftover</li>
			<li>Tearing the bread into small pieces makes for crispier croutons with crevices that catch the dressing!</li>
			<li>Our croutons recipe is for garlic croutons, which have the perfect savory flavor</li>
			<li>You’ll use a low temperature, 300 degrees, and bake until just crispy. The croutons crisp up after baking </li>
